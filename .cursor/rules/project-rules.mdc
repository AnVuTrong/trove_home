# Cursor rules:

## Frontend Code:
- Prefer YARN instead of NPM or NPX
- Use GraphQL, Relay or Redux
- Use Typescript

## Project frontend stucture:
- Use Prettier format
- Use Tailwind CSS
- Don't let a file get too long pass 200 lines
- All code must be placed in src directory with separate backend and frontend
- Always add a suffix at the end of the files' name and directory to clarify its beloging.
    - First example: a head component file name should be HomePageHeader.component.tsx
    - Second example: a page file name should be HomePage.page.tsx
    - Third example: a grouped components directory should be button.components and inside src/components
